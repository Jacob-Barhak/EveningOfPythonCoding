Evening of Python Coding
========================

This page contains references to evening of python coding meetups that were held in Austin TX alongside the [Austin python meetup](https://www.meetup.com/austinpython/).
In this gathering, python programmers gathered and presented demos of various python tools and libraries. This page collects links to those demos and meetup pages in hope those demos will be useful.



Meetup Format
-------------
1. Gathering - where folk gathered and setup their computers
2. Announcements - brief statements by attendees about events, and other python related issues
3. Demo - short presentation with many questions
4. Working groups - break out into multiple smaller working group such as python learners, web, data science, automation, and whatever attendees suggested
